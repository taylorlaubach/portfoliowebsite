			<h3>The Issue:</h3>

			<p>An important overlay was being ignored. It was designed to alert users to possible duplicate records when they added a new client to the system.I found, however, that most users were looking at one or two of the possible duplicates and ignoring any others.</p>

			<h3>The Process:</h3>

			<p>My analysis showed that there were two reasons for this:</p>

			<ol>	
				<li>The existing display was difficult to read. Data was not labelled, so users had to rely on their recognition of the format of numbers like zip code, birthdate, SSN, and phone number to understand what they were comparing.</li>

				<li>Users could only see one record at a time.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>The Solution:</h3>

			<p  class="final">I fixed this by widening the overlay to use more of the available screen real-estate and laying out the data in table format. Each data item is now clearly labelled, and each possible duplicate record takes only one line. Users can easily tell what they are looking at, how it is organized, and how many records they are comparing.</p>
