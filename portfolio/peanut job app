User Experience Designer
IT & Technology | San Francisco, CA, United States

Description:
 
Think you've got the UI design skills and product design sensibility to wow millions of users each month? If so, Peanut Labs wants to hear from you. Peanut Labs develops innovative online market research and advertising technologies and services that deliver instant access to users of social media. We're looking for a designer that can create world class graphical user interfaces and can detail out how the product and its interfaces behave. We want someone who wants to create interactive products that amaze and are simple to use. If you want your inner creative soul to stay alive by facing interesting challenges every day, then this is the opportunity for you.
 
Responsibility:
- Be responsible for making sure the usability and appearance of our applications are world class



- Play a key role in the visual design of new interactive features launching on the site

I recently redesigned every page in a software system in order to incorporate a new style sheet that I designed in concert with our visual designer. Our goal was to unify the look of the site (a hodgepodge of modules from other systems) and ensure that users had consistent cues sitewide to visually represent things like hierarchies of information, items opened from lists, and sets of filters. After designing the style sheet, I incorporated it in new mockups for every screen and a written spec for the development team. I then QA'd the implementation before presenting it to business stakeholders.

- Be focused in deploying innovative products that maximizes ease-of-use for a wide range of end-users

- Utilize the significant creative freedom to experiment with new designs and bring forth new feature ideas

- Work closely with other teams to understand their needs and optimize ease-of-use across our applications.


- Strive for design perfection but love to release and iterate.

- Excellent portfolio: A history of launching top notch web interfaces
- Passion for UI design: You love the world of design and are always keeping on top of the most recent design and usability improvements
- Skilled in Minimalist Design: You understand why an interface needs to be minimalist and know how to cut away the clutter to make a design that just works.

I am passionate about distilling complex concepts and interactions into straightforward and elegant representations. I love to be challenged, to learn, and to find creative solutions to problems. I have experience designing UX/UI for web applications, and I would love the opportunity to speak with you about doing UX for Peanut Labs. 

As far portfolio:

In your posting, you repeatedly emphasize creativity, problem solving, and a thirst for knowledge and challenges. I need to work for a company that fosters this type of attitude and in a position where it is expected. Let me illustrate what this means to me, with a couple of examples that you won't find on my resume: 1. A year ago I bought a scrapheap sailboat with no idea how anything but the sails worked. A week later I moved in. In the next six months, I learned about, redesigned, and rebuilt the waste and drinking water plumbing systems, the AC and DC electrical systems, a kerosene stove and oven, and many of the sailing systems; I rebuilt the engine (which now runs) and even reupholstered the cushions. I knew nothing about engines, plumbing, electrical, or sewing when I started. 2. I speak five foreign languages. 3. I taught myself HTML and CSS in a weekend and that Monday started coding webpages at work. 4. I'm currently writing my third novel.

My resume is attached. You can find my portfolio on my website at http://taylorlaubach.com. My work has been almost exclusively for proprietary SaaS systems, but you can find a beta version of a website for the San Francisco Aging and Disabled Resource Center at http://demo2.sfgetcare2.com. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my application. I hope to hear from you soon.

All the best,
Taylor
