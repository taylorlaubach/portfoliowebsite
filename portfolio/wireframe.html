			<h3>The Issue:</h3>

			<p>In RFP's, the same request for a supplementary software system had appeared a couple of times. Our Vice President asked me to research the program it was for (the Ombudsman Program) and design a software system to meet their business needs.</p>

			<h3>The Process:</h3>

			<p>The Ombudsman Program takes complaints from nursing home residents and attempts to resolve their disputes. All of the work done by an individual worker needs to be written up once a year and reported to the government.</p>

			<p>After researching their business needs and reading their training materials, I made a list of the different tasks they complete in their day-to-day work. I organized these tasks into workflows. I then added in the reporting information that needed to be gathered during each step in order to allow the system to write the yearly reports for the ombudsmen. My goal was for the software to manage all of their workflows and store their work in such a way that they could simply click a button to generate their yearly federal report.</p>

			<p>I brought the first draft (a hand drawn sketch with annotations in the margins) to my Project Manager. He gave me some notes, and I iterated in Balsamiq until we agreed that we had a final product. It is currently in development.</p>

			<h3>The Solution:</h3>

			<p>The images below show all the screens in the software. The first image is a map of how the screens relate to each other. The idea is to make the software as intuitive as possible. The choices on a given page are limited based on the logistics of the program's workflow.</p>

			<p  class="final">For instance, an ombudsman's work starts when a person calls them. They write down the information provided by the caller, and the screen changes based on the type of interaction in the phone call. If the call requires the opening of a new case, all the information in the call populates the case screen. That screen contains a list of to-do&#8217;s. As each to-do is completed, it adds itself to the yearly report.</p>
